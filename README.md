# MeGo_HTML
My first project in MeGo course.


As a participant in the MeGo program's advanced curriculum, I had the opportunity to acquire supplementary skills in Front End development. One of the program requirements was to complete a 4-stage project, which involved creating a website. At the current stage of the project, I have submitted the website in HTML language only, while the design and programming aspects will be addressed in the subsequent stages.
