    <h1>Welcome to Our Beer Categories Page</h1>
    <p>
      At our website, we are proud to offer a wide selection of beers in Israel,

      most of our beers, but also offer a selection of locally brewed beers as
      well. We invite you to explore our beer categories and find the perfect
      beer for your taste. Whether you are a beer enthusiast or a casual
      drinker, we have something for everyone. Below you will find more
      information about each category and the types of beer we offer.

    <h2 id="Alt">Alt Beer</h2>
    <p>
      Alt beer is a German-style beer that is brewed using top-fermenting yeast
      and fermented at a slightly higher temperature than other types of beer.
      This gives it a unique flavor profile that is both malty and hoppy. Our
      selection of alt beers includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Schumacher Alt:</strong> a classic Düsseldorf-style alt beer with a deep amber
        color and a rich, malty flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Diebels Alt:</strong> a slightly lighter alt beer that is brewed with more hops,
        giving it a crisp, bitter finish.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Uerige Alt:</strong> a strong, full-bodied alt beer with a complex flavor profile
        that includes notes of caramel, chocolate, and dark fruit.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Lager">Lager Beer</h2>
    <p>
      Lager beer is a type of beer that is brewed using bottom-fermenting yeast
      and fermented at a cooler temperature than other types of beer. This
      results in a clean, crisp flavor profile that is highly carbonated. Our
      selection of lager beers includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Paulaner Original Münchner Hell:</strong> a classic Bavarian-style lager with a
        golden color and a light, refreshing flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Warsteiner Premium Verum:</strong> a premium German lager that is brewed using
        only the finest ingredients, resulting in a crisp, clean finish.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bitburger Premium Pils:</strong> a highly carbonated pilsner-style lager with a
        bitter, hoppy finish.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Home_Brewing">Home Brewing</h2>
    <p>
      If you're interested in brewing your own beer at home, we offer a
      selection of home brewing supplies and kits. Our home brewing selection
      includes:

    <ul>

        <strong>Brewing equipment:</strong> including fermenters, airlocks, bottling buckets, and
        more.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ingredients:</strong> including hops, malt extracts, yeast, and brewing sugars.
